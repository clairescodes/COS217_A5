statement in a program be executed at least once during
program testing.
- tests and expected outputs (line word character) - 
mywcStatement1.txt: 
mywcStatement2.txt: 
mywcStatementPunctuations.txt:

(large data sets, Textual data sets containing non-ASCII chars, 
Binary data sets,  Randomly generated data sets)
- tests and expected outputs (line word character) -
