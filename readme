them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

What is your mywc program test plan?

There are three main testing methods mentioned 
in lecture.

1. Boundary Testing  
A testing technique using input values at, 
just below, and just above, the defined limits of an
input domain; and with input values causing outputs to be at, 
just below, and just above, the defined limits of an output domain.
(large data sets, Textual data sets containing non-ASCII chars, 
Binary data sets,  Randomly generated data sets)
- tests and expected outputs (line word character) - 
mywcEmpty.txt: This file has zero characters. 
This thus tests program behavior with no input.
0       0       0
mywcOneChar.txt: This file contains one character without newlines.
Thus it tests boundary minimal input. 
0       1       1
mywcOneWhite.txt: This file contains one whitespace. 
Thus it tests word counting logic on whitespace. 
0       0       0
mywcNoNewLine.txt: This file contains words with no newline character
Thus it tests if word counting works without newline terminating the
file. 
0       3      13
mywcSpecialCharacters.txt: This file contains word with special
characters like tabs and newlines. 
0       1      17

mywcReallyLongWord.txt: 
mywcReallyBigFile.txt: 
mywcTooMuchWhiteSpace.txt: 
mywcRanadomInput.txt: 
mywcTooMuchNewLine.txt: 

2. Statement Testing: Testing to satisfy the criterion that each 
statement in a program be executed at least once during
program testing.
- tests and expected outputs (line word character) - 
mywcStatement1.txt:       
0       3      13
mywcStatement2.txt:      0       1      15
mywcPunctuations.txt:      0       3      19

3. Stress Testing
- tests and expected outputs (line word character) -
